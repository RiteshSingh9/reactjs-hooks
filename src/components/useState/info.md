# useState

-   The useState lets us to add state to functional components.
-   In classes, the state is always an object
-   with the useState hook, the state don't have to be an object.
-   useState hook returns an array with 2 elements.
-   The first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function.
-   New state value depends on the previous value of the state? You can pass a funciton to the setter function.
-   When dealing wiht objects or array, make suere to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.
